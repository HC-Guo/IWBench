"View" option is on the right side. The menu bar is displayed in a black background, and the screen is empty, with no content visible.

To generate the corresponding web code for this image, you would need to create an HTML file with a `<nav>` element containing the menu bar. The `<nav>` element should have a class or an ID to style it with CSS. Inside the `<nav>` element, you would add three `<a>` elements for each menu option, with the appropriate text and CSS styles. The `<a>` elements should have `href` attributes pointing to the corresponding pages or functions.

Here's an example of the web code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Menu Bar Example</title>
  <style>
    nav {
      background-color: black;
      color: white;
      padding: 10px;
    }
    nav a {
      color: white;
      text-decoration: none;
      padding: 5px;
      margin: 5px;
    }
    nav a:hover {
      background-color: gray;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <nav>
    <a href="#">File</a>
    <a href="#">Edit</a>
    <a href="#">View</a>
  </nav>
</body>
</html>
```
This code creates a simple menu bar with the three options "File," "Edit," and "View." The CSS styles are applied to the `<nav>` and `<a>` elements to achieve the desired appearance.
