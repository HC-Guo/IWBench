example of the HTML code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Foreign Language Text</title>
	<style>
		body {
			background-color: white;
			font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
			font-size: 16px;
			text-align: center;
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<p>Foreign Language Text</p>
</body>
</html>
```
This code creates a simple webpage with a white background, centered text, and a title. The content of the webpage is the line of text written in the foreign language. To display the text in Chinese, one would need to use a font that supports the Chinese language, such as SimSun or Microsoft YaHei.
