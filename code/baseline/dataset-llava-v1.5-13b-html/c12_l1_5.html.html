image, we would need to know the specific details of the video player and the content of the text box. However, a general example of HTML code for a video player with a video playing could be:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Video Player</title>
	<style>
		body {
			background-color: blue;
		}
		.text-box {
			background-color: white;
			padding: 10px;
			border: 1px solid black;
			margin: 10px;
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<div class="text-box">
		<p>Chinese characters</p>
	</div>
	<video controls>
		<source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		<p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p>
	</video>
</body>
</html>
```
This code creates a simple web page with a blue background, a white text box containing Chinese characters, and a video player with a video playing. Note that the video file "video.mp4" should be replaced with the actual file name and path of the video you want to play.
