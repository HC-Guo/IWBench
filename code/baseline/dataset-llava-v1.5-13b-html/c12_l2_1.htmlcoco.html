image, we would need to know the specific details of the video player and the video content. However, a general example of HTML and CSS code for a video player with a green background could be:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Video Player</title>
	<style>
		body {
			background-color: green;
		}
		video {
			width: 80%;
			height: 600px;
			position: relative;
			top: 50%;
			left: 50%;
			transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<video src="video.mp4" controls>
		Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>
</body>
</html>
```
This code creates a basic video player with a green background, and the video content would be loaded through the `src` attribute of the `video` tag. The `controls` attribute adds the default video player controls, such as play, pause, and volume.
