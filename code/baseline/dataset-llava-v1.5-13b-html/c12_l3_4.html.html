the corresponding web code for this image, you would need to create an HTML file with the necessary elements. Here's an example of the code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Video Player</title>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.16.0/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
	<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<div class="container">
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<video controls>
					<source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
					Your browser does not support the video tag.
				</video>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</body>
</html>
```
This code creates a basic video player using HTML5 and Bootstrap. The video file is assumed to be named "video.mp4" and is located in the same directory as the HTML file. The Facebook logo is not included in this code, as it would require additional CSS and JavaScript to display it properly.
