of the image, such as the text box, its position on the screen, and any other relevant details.

For example, if the text box is an input field, the web code could include HTML elements like `<input type="text" id="input-field">` and CSS styles to set the text box's appearance, such as `width`, `height`, `border`, and `background-color`. If the text box is a part of a larger form, the web code could also include elements like `<form>` and `<label>` to create a complete form structure.

However, without more specific details about the image, it is not possible to provide a precise web code example.
