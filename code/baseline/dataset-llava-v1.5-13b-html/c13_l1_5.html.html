web code, you would need to create a table with the appropriate HTML tags, such as `<table>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>`. Within the table, you would place the list of items, ensuring that each item is separated by a horizontal line using the `<hr>` tag. The text for each item should be written in the appropriate language, using a combination of Chinese and English characters.

Here is an example of the web code for the list:
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Item 1</td>
    <td>Item 2</td>
    <td>Item 3</td>
    <td>Item 4</td>
    <td>Item 5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Item 6</td>
    <td>Item 7</td>
    <td>Item 8</td>
    <td>Item 9</td>
    <td>Item 10</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
This code would create a table with two rows, each row containing a list of five items. The items are separated by horizontal lines, and the text is written in a combination of Chinese and English characters.
