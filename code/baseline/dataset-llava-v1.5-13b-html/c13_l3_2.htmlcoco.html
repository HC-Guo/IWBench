a blank page:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Blank Page</title>
</head>
<body>
	<!-- No content is added to the page -->
</body>
</html>
```
This code defines a basic HTML document with a title and a body section. The title is "Blank Page," and the body section is empty, as there is no content added to the page. You can customize the content and structure of the page by adding various HTML tags, CSS styles, and JavaScript code.
