corresponding web code, you would need to create an HTML file with the following structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Login Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="login-form">
        <form>
            <label for="username">Username:</label>
            <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
            <br>
            <label for="password">Password:</label>
            <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>
            <br>
            <button type="submit">Login</button>
        </form>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
This code creates a simple login form with a username and password input field. The form is wrapped in a div with the class "login-form" to apply any desired styling. The button type is set to "submit" to trigger the form submission when clicked.

You can then customize the appearance and functionality of the login form by adding CSS and JavaScript code to the HTML file.
