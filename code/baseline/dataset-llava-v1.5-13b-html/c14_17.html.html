of the website. The website appears to be about red pandas and their habitat.

To generate the corresponding web code, one would need to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the layout, design, and functionality of the website. The HTML would define the structure of the website, including the menu bar and the images of the red pandas. The CSS would be used to style the website, such as setting the background color and font styles. JavaScript would be used to add interactivity and functionality to the website, such as creating a smooth scrolling effect when the user clicks on the menu options.

Here is a basic example of the HTML code for the website:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Red Pandas</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>

			<li><a href="#digital-garden">Digital Garden</a></li>
			<li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
			<li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
		</ul>
