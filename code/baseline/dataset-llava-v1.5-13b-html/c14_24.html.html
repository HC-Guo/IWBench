Here's a basic example of the HTML code for the website:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Travel Blog</title>
    <style>
        /* Add CSS styles for the layout and design */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- Add header content, such as a logo and navigation menu -->
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Coffee and Cafes</h2>
            <p>Learn about the best coffee shops around the world</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Adventure Activities</h2>
            <p>Discover exciting outdoor activities and experiences</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Hot Air Balloons</h2>
            <p>Explore the beauty of hot air balloons and their destinations</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Family Travel</h2>
            <p>Find family-friendly destinations and activities</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Travel Tips and Tricks</h2>
            <p>Learn how to plan and enjoy your travels</p>
        </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <!-- Add footer content, such as contact information and copyright notice -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```
This is just a basic example, and the actual web code would require more details and specific design elements based on the image input.
