placeholders with the actual values for the photographer's username, image number, and image size. For example, if the photographer's username is "john\_doe" and the image number is "100", the code would look like this:
```html
<img src="https://www.flickr.com/photos/john_doe/100/large">
```
This code will display the image from the photographer's Flickr account, with the specified image number and size.
