." The table is empty, with no visible content in the cells.

To generate the corresponding web code, you would need to create an HTML file with the appropriate structure and content. Here's an example of what the HTML code might look like:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Fashionista Trends</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Fashionista Trends</h1>
	<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>New Products</th>
				<th>Product Name</th>
				<th>Product Description</th>
				<th>Hot Selling Items</th>
				<th>Discount Area</th>
				<th>Product Image</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<!-- Add rows with content here -->
		</tbody>
	</table>
</body>
</html>
```
This code creates a basic HTML structure for a table with six columns. You would need to add content to the cells by filling in the appropriate information for each row.
