a website, and the image captures the essence of the fashion trends being showcased.

To generate the corresponding web code for this chart, one would need to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML would define the structure of the chart, including the different sections and their labels. The CSS would be used to style the chart, including the colors, font, and layout. JavaScript would be used to create the interactivity and dynamic behavior of the chart, such as updating the data and responding to user interactions.

Here is a basic example of the HTML code for the chart:
```html
<div class="chart">
  <div class="section new-products">
    <h3>New Products</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Product 1</li>
      <li>Product 2</li>
      <li>Product 3</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="section hot-selling">
    <h3>Hot Selling Items</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Product 4</li>
      <li>Product 5</li>
      <li>Product 6</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="section discount-area">
    <h3>Discount Area</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Product 7</li>
      <li>Product 8</li>
      <li>Product 9</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
```
This code provides a basic structure for the chart, with each section having a distinct class name. The CSS and JavaScript would then be used to style and interact with the chart, respectively.
