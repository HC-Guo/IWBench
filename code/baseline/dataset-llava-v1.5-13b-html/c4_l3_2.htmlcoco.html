corresponding web code, you would need to create an HTML file with the appropriate structure and content. Here's an example of the HTML code for the product description page:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Product Description</title>
</head>
<body>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Product Name</th>
			<td>Fashion Product</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Price</th>
			<td>$100</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Description</th>
			<td>This is a fashion product with a unique design and high-quality materials. It is perfect for those who want to make a statement and stand out from the crowd.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</body>
</html>
```
This code creates a simple table with three rows, each containing a product name, price, and description. You can customize the content and structure of the table to match the specific product and information you want to display.
