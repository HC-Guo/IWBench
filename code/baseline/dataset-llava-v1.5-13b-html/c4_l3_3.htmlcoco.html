="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 20px; background-color: blue;">
  </div>
</div>
```
This code creates a white background with a blue horizontal line across the top. The horizontal line is created using a `div` element with a `position: absolute` property, which is positioned at the top left corner of the screen. The `height` property of the `div` is set to 100% to ensure that it spans the entire height of the screen.
