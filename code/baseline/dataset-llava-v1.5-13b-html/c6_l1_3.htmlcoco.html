chart could be:
```html
<div class="flowchart">
  <div class="node" data-id="1">
    <div class="node-content">
      <h3>Topic 1</h3>
      <p>Subtopic 1</p>
      <p>Subtopic 2</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="node" data-id="2">
    <div class="node-content">
      <h3>Topic 2</h3>
      <p>Subtopic 1</p>
      <p>Subtopic 2</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- Add more nodes and connections as needed -->
</div>
```
This code snippet provides a basic structure for a flowchart using HTML and CSS. The `div` elements with the `class` attribute set to "flowchart" and "node" define the overall layout and individual nodes, respectively. The `data-id` attribute is used to store unique identifiers for each node, which can be used to create connections between them. The `node-content` `div` element contains the content of each node, including the topic and subtopics.
