. The website also has a subscribe button, which is located below the main image.

To generate the corresponding web code for this website, one would need to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML code would include the structure of the website, such as the header, main content, and footer. The CSS code would be used to style the website, including the layout, colors, and fonts. The JavaScript code would be used to add interactivity and functionality to the website, such as the subscribe button.

Here is a simplified example of the HTML code for the technology news website:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Technology News</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
	<header>
		<h1>Technology News</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<img src="cell-phone.jpg" alt="Cell phone image">
		<p>Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest technology news.</p>
		<button id="subscribe-button">Subscribe</button>
	</main>
	<footer>
		<p>Copyright Â© 2023 Technology News</p>
	</footer>
	<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
This code provides a basic structure for the technology news website, including the header, main content, and footer. The CSS and JavaScript code would be used to style the website and add functionality, such as the subscribe button.
