Replace "VIDEO\_ID" with the actual video ID from the YouTube URL. The "center" class is used to center the video and the button within the container. The "controls" attribute is added to the video element to display the video player controls. The "subscribe-button" class is used to style the button as a simple, unobtrusive element.
