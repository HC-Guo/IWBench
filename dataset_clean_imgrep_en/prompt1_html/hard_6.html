</html>The above code is a basic design that can be extended here according to your needs, such as adding modal windows/pop ups, audio and video elements, comment areas, etc. As this is a static HTML website, certain features require backend support, such as comment sections and contact forms, which require other server-side languages such as PHP, Node.js, etc. For responsive design, you can use CSS's @ media queries or use methods such as the Bootstrap design framework to achieve it.
